## PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.2

PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.2, both regular and Gold, have been sent for review. The Gold version has passed and will roll out today. For the free version status, see below.

* Metal/Vulkan-based rendering through MoltenVK, for better performance
* Much improved UI text rendering
* Many bug and crash fixes
* Support for RetroAchievements and nickname change (soft keyboard support)
* Swipe from left edge to go back

## PPSSPP free version stalled in App Store review

This is the status of my apps in the App Store as I'm writing this, just before triggering the rollout of 1.17.2:

<img src="/static/img/news/ios-app-connect.png" alt="Picture of App Connect, showing the free version taken down" />

I'm trying everything to get the free version up again:

* I've responded to the complaint and taken down most things from the homebrew store
* I've requested an expedited review
* I've sent a new version for review

But nothing seems to work, it's been four days since the takedown now.

If anyone knows what else I can do, email me at hrydgard+ppsspp@gmail.com.

Below you can find Apple's complaint (which, if accurate, would also apply to the Gold version, since it had the same contents in the homebrew store). Note that despite the complaint giving a 14-day deadline, the app was taken down immediately, which is odd. Additionally, in my opinion the complaint is incorrect because I don't believe anything previously on the homebrew store actually did infringe upon copyright.
