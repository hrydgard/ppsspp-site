# Networking

## Networking

Multiplayer documentation is currently [hosted on the PPSSPP GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/wiki/How-to-play-multiplayer-games-with-PPSSPP).

### Enable networking/WLAN

This corresponds to the physical WLAN switch on the real PSP. It's recommended to turn this off if you are not going to play multiplayer - a few games like Obscure will enable networking if this is on, which turns off save states.

### Change MAC address

You can change the MAC address of the emulated PSP here. However, it's not recommended to change it once you have set it - since some games will lock savegames to the specific address, invalidating them if you change it!

### WLAN channel

This setting doesn't really do anything meaningful, considering removing it.

### Send Discord "Rich Presence" information

This setting is currently only available on Windows. It will send information to a Discord client running on the same Windows session, showing it as "currently playing" if you are currently sharing your status.

## Ad hoc multiplayer

### Try to use server-provided packet relay

See [How to play](/docs/multiplayer/how-to-play) for more information.

## Infrastructure

This is the setup to use when playing on infrastructure revival servers.

See [Infrastructure servers](/docs/multiplayer/infrastructure-servers) for more information.
