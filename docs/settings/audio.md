# Audio Settings

## Audio playback

### Playback mode

Classic for the lowest latency, smooth for less glitches when running at speeds other than 100%.

## Game volume

### Enable sound

Turns on or off sound globally.

### Game volume

Sets the overall volume of sound during gameplay.

### Reverb volume

Lets you separately control the volume of reverb and echo effects. PPSSPP's implementation of these isn't 100% accurate and it can be a little loud in some cases, or maybe you just don't like reverb - if so, just turn this down a bit.

### Alternate speed volume

Audio isn't very clean when running at alternate speeds, especially when Playback mode is set to Classic, so if you don't like that, turn this down.

## UI sound

This controls built-in sound effects when navigating the UI.

### Game preview volume

When selecting games on the main screen, some will play the built-in music loop supplied on the disc. These might be too loud, so you can turn them down here.

## Audio backend

### Device

Choose your audio device here, or leave it at Auto.

### Use new audio devices automatically

If this is checked, sound will move to any new audio devices that you plug in.

## Microphone

Here you can pick the device to use for PSP microphone emulation. Very few games make use of this.
